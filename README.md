# JPMorgan Inspired Loan Application

A modern loan application system built with React, TypeScript, and JPMorgan's Salt Design System. Currently features a comprehensive loan list page with search, filtering, and management capabilities. Additional features are planned for future releases.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v22.16.0
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone and install**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd loan-application-form
   npm install
   ```

2. **Setup environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following configuration:

   ```bash
   # Create environment file

   ```

   **Required environment variables:**

   ```env

   VITE_PUBLIC_TANSTACK_GARBAGE_COLLECTION_TIME=600000
   VITE_PUBLIC_API_TIMEOUT=300000
   ```

3. **Start the application**

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start the JSON Server
   npm run server

   # Terminal 2: Start the Frontend

### Planned Features

1. **Personal Information**: Name, email, phone validation
2. **Financial Details**: Income, loan amount, employment status
3. **Review & Submit**: Data summary with confirmation

## üß™ Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
npm run server   # Start mock API server
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### JSON Server Search Behavior

The current implementation uses JSON Server for the mock API, which has specific search limitations:

- **Exact Match Required**: The search functionality requires typing the complete name to get results
- **No Partial Matching**: JSON Server doesn't support partial text matching out of the box
- **Case Sensitive**: Search is case-sensitive by default

**Example**: To find "John Doe", you need to type the complete name "John Doe" rather than just "John" or "Doe".

**Workaround**: For development purposes, try typing the full name as it appears in the database for best results.

**Note**: This is a demonstration project inspired by JPMorgan's design principles.
